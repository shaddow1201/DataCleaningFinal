# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Final Project

## Intro
This repository contains my work for the Coursera course - **Getting and Cleaning Data**

## Data
Base Data: "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"

Data Detail: "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones"

## R Script - run_analysis.R
This is the script that processes the data.  It expects the data to be in the current directory with the proper subdiretories contained in the original zip data archive.

## Codebook.md
This file explains the processing steps in the R script and any transforms that were done, including result sets, and variables.
